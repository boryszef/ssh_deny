ssh_deny.py: a small Python script to block annoying attempts of brute-force
attacks on SSH and SMTP ports.

The script listens to logs for lines that indicate break-in attempts.
When it detects a certain number of lines that match predefined expressions,
all coming from the same IP address and within a specified period of time,
that IP address is added to blocked. Blocking is done by adding a rule to
iptables.

Basic configuration can be done in the script itself:
timeout - after this time (in seconds) a failed attempts is retired and
          no longer considered
treshold - these many attempts within [timeout] constitute a break-in
           attempt
mail_server - SMTP server used to send emails
recipient - e-mail address of the person to send notifications to
sender - sender of the notifications
reply_to - e-mail address for the reply-to field
hostname - used to build a message ID
