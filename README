ssh_deny.py: a small Python script to block annoying attempts of brute-force
attacks on SSH and SMTP ports.

The script listens to logs for lines that indicate break-in attempts.
When it detects a certain number of lines that match predefined expressions,
all coming from the same IP address and within a specified period of time,
that IP address is added to blocked. Blocking is done by adding a rule to
iptables.
